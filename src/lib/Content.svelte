        A variation upon Scott McCloud's original 24h comic challenge, which was
        started in the 90s. The challenge is simple, make a comic in a limited
        amount of time, at the rate of one page per hour. So in this case, 12
        hours to make 12 pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point is to have fun and challenge yourself. Managing to finish it
        in time is very hard and a lot of professional people have failed ! (For
        example, Neil Gaiman !) So don't be afraid to try and fail !
